/*
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
 *
 * Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
